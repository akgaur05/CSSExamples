                <p>
                    Ned Stark (seasons 1, 6â€“7) portrayed by Sean Bean as an adult, Sebastian Croft as a child, and Robert Aramayo as a young adult. Eddard "Ned" Stark of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, becomes the Hand of the King after Lord Jon Arryn's death. He is known for his sense of honor and justice. He took part in Robert's Rebellion after his sister Lyanna was kidnapped by Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. When Ned's father and brother went south to reclaim her, the "Mad King" Aerys Targaryen burned both of them alive. Ned and Robert Baratheon led the rebellion to unseat him from the throne.
                    As the show opens, Ned has been content to remain in the north, but after the death of Lord Jon Arryn, he is convinced that it is his duty to accept the position of Hand of the King.

                  <h2>Casting</h2>
                  <p>
                        Nina Gold and Robert Sterne are the series' primary casting directors.Through a process of auditions and readings, the main cast was assembled. 
                        The only exceptions were Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, whom the writers wanted from the start; they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009.Other actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon.
                        Addy was, according to showrunners Benioff and Weiss, the easiest actor to cast for the series, being that his audition was on point.Some of the characters in the pilot were recast for the first season: Catelyn Stark was initially played by Jennifer Ehle, but the role was recast with Michelle Fairley.
                        Daenerys Targaryen was also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant.The rest of the first season's cast was filled in the second half of 2009.

                  <h2>Writing</h2>
                  <p>
                     Game of Thrones used seven writers in six seasons. Series creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the showrunners, write most of the episodes each season.[61]
                     A Song of Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin wrote one episode in each of the first four seasons. Martin did not write an episode for the later seasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel (The Winds of Winter).Jane Espenson co-wrote one first-season episode as a freelance writer.</p>
